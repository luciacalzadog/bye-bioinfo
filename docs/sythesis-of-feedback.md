# Feedback received
According to the feedback of 5 different students, I found the following aspects to be most important:

- The game is nice now, but it's missing some sort of goal or winning condition. My initial idea was to have a timer until the solution was correct, with the game not letting you place a sequence in the wrong cluster. The students agree this is a terrible idea, apparently. They said repeatedly that being able to make wrong guesses makes it more fun, and unanimously propose or support some type of points system that accounts for the time taken and the accuracy of the final answer (with a leaderboard if possible).

- Many of the students were initially confused by the game mechanics, mostly because of the mismatch between the sequence block size in the spawning and dropping boxes. Hence, the size of the spawning box should be changed to match the dropping box width. Also, the dropping boxes need to be made to take up a fourth of the available space, they are currently a little too small vertically to begin with.

- The comparison to agar.io in the final remarks was quite a flop: most of the students hadn't heard of the game, and made me feel terribly old. This should be changed to something different.

- The students said that the texts often felt too long. I propose using buttons to split up the text in different panels. I also got the comment that schematics and visual elements were appreciated when it comes to explanations, so I would suggest splitting the information into panels and adding some visual elements (drawings etc)

- The difficulty needs to be further tuned. The difference between 3rd and 5th grade is quite small, or unperceivable now. I think the sequences need to be tweaked. Changes at the start are the most difficult, and the easiest changes are in the middle of the sequence.

The rest of the feedback can be found in each student's interview notes.
