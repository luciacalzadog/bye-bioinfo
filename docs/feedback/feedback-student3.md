# Student 3 -- Age: 17
## General
- **UI**

Not sure about the yellow.

Dropping box should be the correct size (it was confusing that only 3 sequences fit with initial dimensions)

- **Intro Text**

Long, but it's very understandable, good comparison

- **Final Text**

Never played agar.io

Understood algorithm well

- **Engagement**

Said she was engaged, but not enthusiastically

- **Game mechanics**

Unclear that you can fit more than 3 blocks per box

For upcoming changes: would like to keep the ability to make mistakes (so not the game preventing you from placing a sequence in the wrong cluster, that's boring). Likes the idea of a points system that takes time and accuracy into account, rather than a race to get the 100% accurate

Thinks it would be better if sequences couldn't be moved after they are dropped (makes it more interesting)

## 3rd grade level
- **Perceived difficulty**

Very easy

Unclear: how you are supposed to match, "I guess you could do it with the last bit too" --> concept wasnt understood.

Unclear what the colors were for

- **Observations of answer**

Correct answer!

Takes quite a long time to start, but then does it fast

## 5th grade level
- **Perceived difficulty**

Easy, feels the same difficulty as 3rd grade

You can feel the change in velocity, but it doesn't matter because you can always "recover" the sequences

- **Observations of answer**

Correct answer!

Waits to see 4-5 sequences before starting.
