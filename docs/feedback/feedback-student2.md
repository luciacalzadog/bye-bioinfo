## General
- **UI**

Good

Should have 2 columns in the spawning box so you can see more sequences at once, and the size of the sequence box doesn't need to change

Needs a solitaire style finish effect :)

- **Intro Text**

Clear

- **Final Text**

Good, a bit long about bioinformatics

- **Engagement**

There is no clear objective, I don't see that I'm winning, which makes it less engaging.

- **Game mechanics**

Clear but lacking an objective (am I trying to do it fast, accurately, without mistakes?)

It's a good thing that sequences can be changed from one box to the other: makes it less of a challenge to start

About possible changes: You should add a leaderboard, and a points system that takes into account accuracy and time. Having the game tell you you're wrong (aka: not let you drop sequences in the wrong cluster) would be less engageing, recommend against it.

## 3rd grade level
- **Perceived difficulty**

Sometimes hard to see which group a sequence belongs to, hesitating between two. As the game goes on, you have more sequences to go off of, so it's easier.

I look at how the sequence starts and how it ends (variability tends to be in the middle)

- **Observations of answer**

Lets the sequences accumulate before starting, then looks at them (not pressed for time).

GC/GA starting sequences by far the hardest

Correct solution!

## 5th grade level
- **Perceived difficulty**

They are more different than the 3rd grade, the variability is mostly in the last part (not middle), so now I looked at the start more.

- **Observations of answer**

GC/GA starting clusters finished first, AAA/ATT a lot faster

Correct solution!
