# Student 1 -- Age: 15
## General
- **UI**

Quite boring with the same colors everywhere

It needs more blue, and purple is not cool

- **Intro Text**

The explanation is good, the comparison works very well, and is age appropriate, it doesn't feel patronizing

It's long

- **Final Text**

Never played agar.io

Too long

I like the schematization: more visual is good

- **Engagement**

Initially got very active (enjoyed the popping up of the sequences)

Doesn't really like biology, so he got bored very fast

- **Game mechanics**

Didn't understand what the size of each cluster is (final solution had inconsistent cluster sizes)

Confused: thought maybe he had to group the sequences so there was one of each type in each box (translation of the instructions probably not clear)

## 3rd grade level
- **Perceived difficulty**

Felt like a 6.5/10 of difficulty, not really clear what he had to do

- **Observations of answer**

Incorrect answer, wrong number of clusters, joined GC and GA starting clusters, but overall the boxes had sequences of the same cluster

## 5th grade level
- **Perceived difficulty**

Didn't feel faster than the 3rd grade one, since you can always access sequences later

- **Observations of answer**

Wrong number of clusters, and inconsistent size (joined the Gs again)
