# Student 4 -- Age: 12
## General
- **UI**

The text on dropping boxes isn't readable --> Remove it, not necessary

Would change the pink.

The color consistency of all windows is nice.

- **Intro Text**

"I'm learning things"

Likes it, it's not too long, not too short

- **Final Text**

agar.io sounds familiar (not confident)

Likes it.

It's nice that it's explained differently than before, but is still linked together.

- **Engagement**

Good :)

- **Game mechanics**

Unclear what to do initially

Hard to drag with the size change

Future changes: thinks a time + accuracy points system makes the most sense/would be the most fun

## 3rd grade level
- **Perceived difficulty**

Didn't understand

- **Observations of answer**

Starts with ATT vs AAA

Would probably need a mouse

Finishes after placing 1 sequence in each box, I refer him back to the information

## 5th grade level
- **Perceived difficulty**

No comments

- **Observations of answer**

Correct answer!! (one mistake, seems like a misclick: one GC/GA is misplaced, wrong size of cluster)
