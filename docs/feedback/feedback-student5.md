## General
- **UI**

The white/light yellow space should be used more, the smaller size of the dropping boxes is strange and confusng, they should take up pretty much all of the white space

- **Intro Text**

Good, it seems too long at first, but after reading it, it warranted the length. Informative

Likes the LEGO comparison

- **Final Text**

Likes that the explanation is expanded, the different kind of information is interesting

- **Engagement**

Yes

- **Game mechanics**

Not clear what to do at first

Should use the counter, it's confusing if there is no indication that you're doing something correct/expected by the game

Future changes: the time + accuracy points system is much better than some sort of accuracy alone measure. It can also be expanded.

## 5th grade level
