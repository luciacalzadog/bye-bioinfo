Welcome to GeneGenius!

In this game, the goal is to group genes with their most similar neighbors.
You know when you use the same piece to make a LEGO dragon, spaceship or
magic castle? Genes are a little like that. They encode for the building
blocks that make up all living things.

Sometimes, this means that very similar genes are being used by many organisms:
for example, the eyes in many animals have similar genes! Knowing what a
gene looks like --or which genes it resembles-- can help us know what it
does, so bioinformaticians work to group them together in what are called
clusters.

Are you ready to do it yourself? Drag similar sequences to the same box to
create a cluster.
