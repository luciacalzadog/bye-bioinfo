Welcome to GeneGenius!

In this game, the goal is to group genes with their most similar neighbors.
You know when you use the same piece to make a LEGO dragon, spaceship or
magic castle? Genes are a little like that. They encode for the building
blocks that make up all living things (like proteins!).

Sometimes, this means that very similar genes are being reused by many organisms:
for example, many animals (even very different ones) share similar genes for their
eyes, muscles, or how their cells divide.

Knowing this, bioinformaticians often figure out what a gene does by comparing
it to others. If genes look similar, they often do similar things too.

This process of classifying genes into groups that resemble each other
is called clustering. This means taking the "spelling" (the sequences) of
many, many genes and sorting them into groups: it's as if you sorted LEGO
pieces into bricks, plates and cylinders, for example.

Are you ready to try it yourself? Drag similar sequences to the same box to
create a cluster.
