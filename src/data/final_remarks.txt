Great job: you did it!

That was fun, right? And sorting through a few sequences is relatively
easy (how fast can you do it?). But imagine trying to sort through thousands
(or millions) of sequences... You would have to be sitting in front of a
screen for a veeery long time.

No one has that much free time. That's why bioinformaticians make the
computers do it! A very important part of the job is writing algorithms that
will make the computers solve difficult or time consuming problems for us.

For this case, one possible algorithm works like this:

1. Make each sequence its own cluster
2. Use math formulas to calculate how different each cluster is (their distance)
3. Merge the two closest clusters into one.
4. Repeat until you have the correct number of clusters

Have you ever played agar.io?
It's a little like that: the clusters "eat" their closest neighbors and become
bigger and bigger until you stop the program.

This (and other) algorithms are often used to cluster genes, and that is
done all the time! To discover what new genes do, or make new drugs,
track diseases... All sorts of things.

This was a short look at what bioinformatics can do, I hope you enjoyed it!
